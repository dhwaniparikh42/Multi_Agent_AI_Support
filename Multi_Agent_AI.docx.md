This project is best treated as an **industry-level capstone project** rather than a simple chatbot. The guide below is designed so that students can complete it, while learning modern AI concepts such as Multi-Agent Systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and LLM integration.

---

**Project Title**

**Multi-Agent AI Customer Support Assistant using RAG and LLMs**

---

**1\. Project Objective**

Design and develop a web-based AI-powered customer support assistant capable of answering customer queries using multiple specialized AI agents.

Unlike a normal chatbot, this system should:

* Understand customer intent

* Route the request to the correct AI agent

* Retrieve relevant company information

* Generate accurate responses

* Maintain conversation history

* Escalate unresolved issues

---

**2\. Learning Outcomes**

After completing this project, students should understand:

* Multi-Agent Systems

* Large Language Models (LLMs)

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Embedding Models

* Vector Databases

* REST APIs

* Full Stack Development

* Cloud Deployment

---

**3\. Problem Statement**

Companies receive thousands of customer queries every day. A single chatbot often struggles to answer questions from different domains such as billing, technical support, product information, and complaints.

The objective is to build a **Multi-Agent AI System** where each AI agent specializes in one domain, and a central orchestrator routes queries to the appropriate agent(s).
